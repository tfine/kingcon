  <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
  <p>My name is Todd Fine, and I direct an arts advocacy organization based in New York called the <a href="http://washingtonstreet.group">Washington Street Advocacy Group</a>. I am also a PhD candidate in intellectual history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. For the last year, I have devoted a tremendous and inordinate amount of time to an "anti-fascism campaign" led by individuals known as <a href="https://twitter.com/ryder_ripps">Ryder Ripps</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Pauly0x">Pauly0x</a> against a company named "<a href="https://www.yuga.com/">Yuga Labs</a>" who created a NFT collection of monkey pictures called "<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>", which have been promoted by celebrities like Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Justin Bieber. I believe that it is an extremely important effort and that it must be won in order to expose dangerous ideological trends in American society and politics, including the interest of elements of the Silicon Valley billionaire class in esoteric philosophies that can only be described as fascism. Ryder Ripps has a website called <a href="https://gordongoner.com/">GordonGoner.com</a> where he describes his conviction that the BAYC collection is "racist and contains Nazi dog whistles" and how the founders of Yuga Labs, Wylie Aronow and Greg Solano, are inspired by "Nazism." I agree with Ryder Ripps in part, preferring other terms rather than Nazism. This website is a friendly adaption of his and a mild tweaking of someone I once considered a friend and who is unfortunately now estranged.</p>

  <p>As an arts writer and a historian, I encountered the anti-Yuga Labs campaign after attending the <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NFTNYC conference</a> in June 2022. Despite being a lifelong programmer and cryptography enthusiast, I have largely stayed away from cryptocoins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin because I believe that they are unethical and largely designed to steal wealth from the least sophisticated investors. However, my friend Kristen Visbal -- the artist who made the Fearless Girl statue in Lower Manhattan -- was looking into <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/23/fearless-girl-creator-turns-to-nfts-to-pay-3m-legal-fees/">Ethereum NFTs</a> as a way to earn money to help pay millions of dollars of legal fees from a lawsuit against the bank State Street Global Advisors, which has been suing her in a naked attempt to bankrupt her and seize her copyright for the statue. Together we attended the largest NFT conference in order to make connections, and I resolved to pay for my ticket by trying to write a <a href="https://hyperallergic.com/745115/crypto-believers-look-for-utility-at-nft-nyc/">freelance piece</a> about it.</p>
    
    <p></p>I remember being shocked when I went into <a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/person-walks-by-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-characters-inside-news-photo/1404339751?adppopup=true">Radio City Music Hall</a> and saw it plastered with posters announcing a trilogy of films, bankrolled by <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, about these Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which looked quite strange and suspicious to me. Afterward, I wrote a piece about the conference and then resolved to participate further in the NFT scene as a "gonzo journalist." I knew that the only way to learn more about Bored Ape Yacht Club and about this environment was to dive into it and its so-called "degen" liftstyle.</p>

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjrA-slMoZ4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <p>Alongside meeting a lot of interesting people and programmers, I discovered behavior in NFTs and so-called "shitcoins" that demonstrated a level of criminality and deception that I previously did not believe possible. Ethereum has become, with a doubt, the largest platform for scams and fraud that the world has ever seen. Despite having what I thought was a keen eye for deception, several NFT collections lied to me and tricked me. There are millions of victims around the world who have been harmed by both organized and disorganized/decentralized criminal operations. Nearly every NFT or coin project eventually goes to zero, but people in the know repeatedly launch them and figure out ways to ride them for profit until they "rug."</p>
  <p>
  The largest criminality, without a doubt, however, is the company Yuga Labs, which not only has created one of the larger Ponzi schemes in history, but has deceptively rooted its iconography in the "Kali Yuga" philosophy of Julius Evola, one of the world's most disgusting anti-Semitic fascist thinkers who remains the most influential figure for the contemporary alt-right. I will offer evidence below, but there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Yuga Labs has lied repeatedly and fraudulently about its ideology and origins, assertingly, absurdly, that they didn't even know about the fascist meaning of "Kali Yuga" when the collection was created.</p>
    
    <p>After I learned that Ryder and Pauly were being sued by Yuga Labs for launching an collection called RR/BAYC, or Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club, I argued publicly that every decent person in cryptocurrency should back them up. I made memes and participated avidly in dozens of online "Twitter Spaces" along with a merry group of online advocates on this issue. Many people claimed to me that Ryder and Pauly (Jeremy Cahen) had a history of pumping and dumping scammy crypto tokens, but once I was convinced about the underlying matter of Yuga Labs, I treated that question as irrelevant to the matter of Yuga Labs' ideology.</p>

  <p>One of my biggest concerns, however, was that there was almost no serious media coverage of the fascism and racism charges, even though they had been expressed by prominent individuals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Dash">Damon Dash</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc-A-Fella_Records">Roc-A-Fella Records</a>. Thus, in January 2023, I worked with two Coindesk editors over two weeks to produce <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/31/the-nft-community-could-forgive-bayc-founders-esoteric-interests/">an article</a> that would clarify my expert conclusion that Bored Apes Yacht Club was rooted in the "Kali Yuga ideology" of Julius Evola. It was published on the morning of January 31, 2023 and did quite well online. However, by 6pm, the article was removed from the website and was replaced with a statement that said, "<bold>The column by a first-time external contributor was based on inflammatory, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and as such never should have been published. Accordingly, the content has been removed. We apologize for the editorial lapse</bold>." I subsequently had a conversation with my editorial contact who told me that Yuga Labs had threatened Coindesk with a lawsuit for libel for publishing the piece. There were no conspiracy theories in the piece, as I had attempted to explain the philosophical meaning of "Kali Yuga" and how it was tied to the name of both the company and the collection, and to a Telegram group called "Kali Yuga Surfing Club" that was rooted in the philosophical writing of Julius Evola. It is obvious to me that "Surf the Kali Yuga" is a reference to Evola's 1961 book, Ride The Tiger.</p>

<p>After my power of my pen was curtailed, I became more and more frustrated about the lack of progress in my activism against Yuga Labs. I began holding regular livestreams from the <a href="https://www.ilholocaustmuseum.org/">Illinois Holocaust Museum</a> in Skokie where I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JZPaN34zA">a press event with WGN</a> and tried to inform my Twitter audience about the proper lessons of the Holocaust. In late February, I attended the Ethereum conference in Denver, ETHDenver, and protested the ambilivance of conference participants and Ethereuem leaders toward the presence of fascist ideology in Yuga Labs. Even though I had only protested with a sign outside of the venue, I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPDyd11he48">blocked from attending the conference</a>. At the end of March, the same day that Gucci announced a partnership with Yuga Labs, I did a quite bold action that was surprising to some people, perhaps including to myself. I went to a Gucci store and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y-fgUB-kKs">arrested protesting</a>. While I cannot speak to the details of the case, my intent was pure and I desperately wanted to bring attention to this matter. I believe that this crime will be resolved.</p>
    
 <p>I also have begun to condemn the role of Hollywood in this matter. In late January, I spoke with a representative of producers who made the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5412043/">Tiger King documentary series</a> and are working on a program about Bored Ape Yacht Club, and I am becoming increasingly alarmed that the tense elements of this situation are being used to provide chaotic scenes for film and television. I cannot for the life of me understand why major elements in Hollywood are taking an interest in this Bored Ape Yacht Club situation without taking stock of the alarming elements and acting.</p>

<p>In the process of all of this activity, I have learned a great deal about the different symbolic languages that younger intellectuals interested in cryptocurrency use to discuss politics and philosophy. Their desperation is channeled through layers of cynicism about the potential for justice. Many collapse into complete nihilism or even into radical embrace of obscure streams of aristocratism and fascism, while only a small sliver maintain hope. In challenging the utterly disgusting Yuga Labs, I have attempted to model a praxis of activism and responsibility for the crypto generation. It is critical that civil rights organizations now listen to the young people who are warning them about rising forms of anti-Semitism and hate.</p>

<h2>Evidence against Yuga Labs</h2>
    
The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection is, quite clearly, a direct homage to the writings of Julius Evola and his concept of "Kali Yuga," and their contemporary memeification by the alt-right, especially on 4chan. In response to my censored Coindesk article as he claimed to be exiting the company due to imminent heart failure, Wylie Aronow asserted absurdly that <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/09/setting-the-record-straight/">he had never heard of the fascist meaning of Kali Yuga</a> when he founded the company. Yet, the evidence in support is overwhelming, and here is a list extracted from an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwZOCmLOib6DBK0YGvqDR4CvJfzmqTLqIk_R6oyhQ-k/edit?usp=sharing">draft article</a> I wrote about the ideological connections between FTX and Yuga Labs:
<ol>
<li>The four-word water sporting title of "Bored Ape Yacht" directly matches the contemporaneous “Kali Yuga Surfing Club,” a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHmCP-6MvEnw0P_kzqonb15Wbmlujk5MSti86QqiYPM/edit?usp=sharing">Telegram group</a> that posted "Surf the Kali Yuga" memes and quotations related to Julius Evola.</li>
<li>The collection’s logo appears to match the SS Totenkopf, an intrinsic element of the “Surf the Kali Yuga” meme.<br /><img src="totenkopf.jpg"/></li>
<li>The company created to administer the NFT collection was named “Yuga Labs.” Yuga Labs initially asserted that "Yuga" was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1478100695404449804">Nintendo Gameboy game</a>, but later, in response to new information, asserted was inspired by founder Wylie Aronow's temporary devotion to Hinduism.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">apes themselves</a> reference anti-Black stereotypes of primitivism and criminality, wearing bone necklaces, grill jewelry, pimp clothes, and prison uniforms. The negative symbolism of Black primitivism is directly countered by extensive, "positive" Evola-adjacent symbolism of monarchy, imperialism, militarism, spiritual transcendence, and sacrifice to the state.</li>
    <li>The artist, <a href="https://twitter.com/allseeingseneca">Seneca</a>, who created the sketches of the original apes themselves acknowledges that racist elements were added after her involvement.<br ><img src="seneca.jpg"</li>
<li>One of the most important traits in the collection is a Prussian helmet, which alludes to the importance of Prussia to Evola as descendent from the Teutonic Order (justifying support for the German Reich as an empire that promotes a spiritual principle greater than the nationalism of mass politics).<img src="6969.png" /></li>
<li>These imperial symbols directly mirror meme images of Pepe/Groyper. An expert in chan culture, 8chan creator Fredrick Brennan who fought QAnon, has said that he <a href="https://fredrickbrennan.medium.com/bayc-bored-ape-yacht-club-the-highest-market-cap-nft-is-racist-nft-racism-e1dc1cb6bc0d">considers it indisputable</a> that the collection reflects extreme chan politics.</li>
<li>Aronow, the creator of the collection, apparently listed “Kali Yuga” as his “location” on his <a href="https://gist.github.com/travisbrown/087ad248748e38b913891fb0a3a03a72/24469d5825bb520795da44725a2459d065f6542d">Twitter account</a>, on which he largely – and angrily – discussed American politics, as well as interacted with various esoteric fascist accounts.</li>
<li>Aronow is <a href="https://waveninja.substack.com/p/thousands-of-lies-wylie-aronow-acknowledges?sd=pf">friends with the founder of Expat</a>, a literary press linked to a larger alt-right publishing scene. Aronow was directly thanked in the acknowledgments of a book full of ethnic and racial slurs.</li>
<li>Solano has also <a href="https://waveninja.substack.com/p/on-gargamel-nazi-allegations-latin">written extensively</a> about Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, who wrote about esoteric Nazism.</li>
<li>In the early phases before the ideological puzzle was pieced together, the company seemingly inserted other edgy references to the <a href="https://waveninja.substack.com/p/the-confederate-koda-interview-with">Confederacy</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/ryder_ripps/status/1560087066444058624?lang=en">myth of Hyperborea</a> into its collections.</li>
  <li>It was recently proven that the core "skull logo" IP of Yuga Labs was <a href="https://decrypt.co/121679/yuga-labs-replacing-bored-ape-kennel-club-logo-copied-kids-drawing-guide">stolen from a website called Easy Drawing Guides</a>. This indicate that this entire endeavor was more immoral than previously assumed.</li>
